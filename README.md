# 🧭 Judge's Evaluation Guide: Flashbook AI

Welcome to the **Flashbook AI** repository. To help you evaluate our "AI for Bharat" submission efficiently, we have mapped our repository structure directly to the judging criteria.

---

## 1. 📋 Documentation & Requirements (Mandatory)
* **Product Requirements (PRD):** [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)
    * *Look for:* **Requirement 3** (AI Content Gen) and **Requirement 5** (Redis Caching) for technical depth.
    * *Look for:* **"Future Roadmap"** at the bottom for our **multilingual "Digital Bharat" strategy**.
* **System Design:** [`design.md`](./design.md)
    * *Look for:* The **Serverless Architecture** breakdown and **Data Flow** specifics.


## 4. 🤖 AI & Innovation
* **Models Used:**
    * **Text:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via Amazon Bedrock) for summarization.
    * **Images:** Amazon Titan Image Generator for educational illustrations.


## 5. 🔍 Proof of Process (The `.kiro` Folder)
* **Path:** [`.kiro/`](./.kiro/)
* **What is this?** This folder contains the raw architectural specs and context used by our AI Architect agent. It serves as **traceability** for our design process, proving that our architecture was systematically generated and refined using modern AI-first workflows, rather than being an afterthought.
